## Lab 1: [General-purpose I/Os (GPIO)](6780_lab1_GPIO)
These exercises explore two basic operations of the GPIO: Blinking LEDs, and reading the state of a
pushbutton.

### 1.5.1.a Configuring a GPIO Pin to Output and Blink an LED
Recreate the blinking demo using the green and orange LEDs on the Discovery board:

- [Blinking with ORANGE and GREEN LED's main.c](<6780_lab1_GPIO/Main files/Main ORANGE and GREEN/main.c>)

### 1.5.1.b Changing to the New LEDs
Recreate the blinking demo using the red and blue LEDs on the Discovery board:

- [Blinking with RED and BLUE LED's main.c](<6780_lab1_GPIO/Main files/Main RED and BLUE/main.c>)

### 1.5.2 Configuring a GPIO Pin to Input and Reading a Button
Change your version of the flashing LED program so that each button press toggles the LEDs instead
of the delay:

- [Input and reading a button main.c](<6780_lab1_GPIO/Main files/Main Button/main.c>)
